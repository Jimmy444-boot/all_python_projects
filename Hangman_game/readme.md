# Hangman Game

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**! This classic word-guessing game challenges players to uncover a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. Be careful, thoughâ€”each incorrect guess brings you closer to the gallows!

## How It Works
- The game selects a random word from a predefined list.
- Players have 6 lives (incorrect guesses) to reveal the word.
- With each correct guess, letters are revealed.
- If you run out of lives before guessing the word, you lose.
