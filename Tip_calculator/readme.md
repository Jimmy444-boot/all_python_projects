## How It Works
1. The script prompts the user to:
   - Enter the total bill amount.
   - Specify the tip percentage they'd like to give (10, 12, or 15).
   - Specify the number of people to split the bill among.
2. It calculates the tip based on the percentage of the bill.
3. Adds the tip to the total bill to calculate the final amount.
4. Divides the total amount by the number of people to determine how much each person should pay.
